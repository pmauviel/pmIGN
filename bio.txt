Hello there,

	My name is Paul Mauviel. I'm 22 years old and currently reside in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

	I graduated HIgh School in 2007 with a specialization certificate in Computer Science. The following year I entered the University of Ottawa (Ottawa,ON,Canada) for a B.Sc. Joint Majors Mathematics and Computer Science. At the end of my first year(August 2008) I decided that I wasn't interested in doing that much math, so I switched to Carleton University(Ottawa, ON, Canada) doing a B.Sc. Computer Science - Game Development Stream. I was at Carleton University for about 2 years, but due to financial reasons was unable to continue attending.

	Throughout my schooling(since 10th grade) I have been working part and full time jobs in a variety of retail and fast food jobs. Most currently, I've been working at Toys R Us Canada since Nov 2010. Previously I have worked in Fast Food (McDonalds, Tim Hortons) and retail (Best Buy, Zellers).

	My interests have always been dominated by video games, and programming. My greatest goal in life is to become a professional game programmer; but being that it's a cutthroat market and I don't have my degree, nor do I have time to make a killer portfolio; I haven't been able to get where I wanted to be. My other interests are quite varied. I played Volleyball competitively throughout High School, and have been trying to find a local recreational league to join. I enjoy other cool things like: juggling, guitar, writing, reading, music, movies, basketball, hockey season and superheroes.

	And that's me in a nutshell.

	Thanks for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.

- Paul
